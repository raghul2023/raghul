            Iâ€™m an MBA Finance student with a strong passion for investment banking, private equity, and financial modeling. I have worked on financial analysis, valuation, and risk assessment projects, including M&A analysis, DCF modeling, and market research. Through internships and projects, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in analyzing financial data and making strategic recommendations. I previously interned at Zielhoch, where I developed insights into financial strategy and business analysis. Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring fintech innovations, staying updated on market trends, and learning advanced valuation techniques. Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges and grow in the finance industry by applying my skills to real-world scenarios.

            <p className="mt-3 p-3 md:text-lg tracking-wide leading-7 text-[var(--secondary)]">I was born in Malappuram, Kerala, but when I was 2 years old, my family moved to Coimbatore. College was a different kind of adventure. Instead of focusing on studies, I spent most of my time playing cricket and attending tournaments. During the last few months of my undergraduate degree, I had no idea what to do next. I received placement offers, but I rejected them because they werenâ€™t in core finance, which was where my real interest lay. Then, I made the decision to pursue an MBA in Finance, which led me to CMS Jain. During my first semester, my mentor casually called me, and we had a chit-chat. During that conversation, she suggested me to develop financial modeling skills. Intrigued, I started learning it. As I dived deeper, I discovered the world of Investment Banking and learned about companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Fast forward a few monthsâ€”I fell in love with Investment Banking. Now, Iâ€™m on a journey to master Financial Modeling, turning what started as an unexpected challenge into a real passion. At the same time, Iâ€™m deepening my knowledge of finance and investment banking. Hopefully, this time with fewer cricket distractions!. ðŸ˜†ðŸ”¥</p>
